# Udacity Nanodegree - Data Structures & Algorithms - Advanced Algorithms

This is the Advanced Algorithms chapter project submitted during the Udacity Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree course.

### Project Text & Purpose

"In this project, you will build a route-planning algorithm like the one used in Google Maps to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map."

The project require the implementation of the [A* algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) to find best route from a node A to a node B in a map.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Requisites

To run python scripts is necessary have installed Python 3 in your environment. On local system i've used Python 3.6 and 3.7 to develop the different projects.
This project has been developed on the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) with python 3
